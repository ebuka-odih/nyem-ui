# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problems Found

1. **No Real Authentication**: Login page was just setting `authState` to 'authenticated' without validating credentials
2. **No API Calls**: No actual backend API calls were being made
3. **No Token Storage**: No authentication tokens were being stored
4. **Bypass Options**: "Skip" and "Continue as Guest" buttons allowed bypassing authentication
5. **No Route Protection**: Routes were not protected - anyone could access authenticated pages

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added API Utilities
- Copied `utils/api.ts` from web2
- Copied `constants/endpoints.ts` from web2
- These provide proper API client with token management

### 2. Implemented Real Login
- Added `handleLogin` function in `LoginPage.tsx`
- Validates email format
- Makes actual API call to `/auth/login` endpoint
- Stores token and user data in localStorage
- Shows error messages for invalid credentials
- Only sets authenticated state after successful login

### 3. Added Token Validation
- Added `useEffect` in `App.tsx` to check for existing token on mount
- Validates token by calling `/profile/me` endpoint
- Clears invalid tokens automatically

### 4. Removed Bypass Options
- Disabled "Skip" functionality in LoginPage
- Changed WelcomePage "Start" to require login
- Disabled "Continue as Guest" functionality

### 5. Protected Routes
- Routes now check for valid authentication token
- Only authenticated users can access main app

## How It Works Now

1. **Login Flow**:
   - User enters email and password
   - Validates input format
   - Calls `POST /api/auth/login` with credentials
   - Backend validates credentials
   - If valid: stores token and user, sets authenticated state
   - If invalid: shows error message, stays on login page

2. **Token Management**:
   - Token stored in `localStorage` as `auth_token`
   - User data stored as `auth_user`
   - Token validated on app load
   - Invalid tokens are cleared automatically

3. **Route Protection**:
   - Checks for `auth_token` in localStorage
   - Only shows authenticated content if token exists
   - Redirects to login if no valid token

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Try wrong credentials**:
   - Enter wrong email/password
   - Should see error message
   - Should NOT be able to login

2. **Try correct credentials**:
   - Enter valid email/password
   - Should successfully login
   - Should see authenticated content

3. **Check token storage**:
   - After login, check browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage
   - Should see `auth_token` and `auth_user`

4. **Test route protection**:
   - Clear localStorage
   - Refresh page
   - Should redirect to login/welcome page

## API Endpoint Used

- **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Body: `{ username_or_phone: string, password: string }`
  - Response: `{ user: {...}, token: string }`

## Environment Configuration

Make sure `.env.local` has:
```env
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.nyem.online/backend/public/api
```

All API calls will use this base URL.
