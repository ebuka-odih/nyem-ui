# Vite Dependency Optimization Fix

## Error
```
The file does not exist at "/Users/gnosis/Herd/nyem/web/node_modules/.vite/deps/chunk-XR2CBHLF.js?v=953e06f7" 
which is in the optimize deps directory. The dependency might be incompatible with the dep optimizer. 
Try adding it to `optimizeDeps.exclude`.
```

## Root Cause
This error occurs when Vite's dependency pre-bundling cache is corrupted or out of sync. The chunk file that Vite expects doesn't exist in the cache directory.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cleared Vite Cache
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
```
This removes the corrupted cache and forces Vite to rebuild it.

### 2. Updated vite.config.ts
Added `force: true` to `optimizeDeps` to force re-optimization:
```typescript
optimizeDeps: {
  include: ['react', 'react-dom', 'framer-motion', 'lucide-react'],
  force: true, // Force re-optimization on startup
},
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Wait for dependency optimization**:
   Vite will show:
   ```
   Pre-bundling dependencies:
   (this will be done only when your dependencies or config have changed)
   ```

3. **If the error persists**, try:
   ```bash
   # Clear everything and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Alternative: Exclude Problematic Dependency

If a specific dependency is causing issues, you can exclude it:

```typescript
optimizeDeps: {
  include: ['react', 'react-dom', 'framer-motion', 'lucide-react'],
  exclude: ['problematic-package'], // Add problematic package here
  force: true,
},
```

## Verification

After restarting, check:
1. No errors in console
2. `node_modules/.vite/deps/` directory is created
3. Chunk files are generated successfully
4. App loads without 404 errors

## Note

The `force: true` option will make Vite re-optimize dependencies on every startup, which is slower but ensures consistency. Once everything works, you can set it back to `false` for faster startup times.
